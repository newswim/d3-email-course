### Hi

There's probably not much to see here. I signed up for Ben Clinkinbeard's [free d3 course].

Also, I wanted to try out [Neutrino] as a project scaffold.

## Get Started

```bash
# install depndencies
$ yarn [npm] install

# start app
$ yarn [npm run] start

# build app
$ yarn [npm run] build
```

\* using `yarn` or `npm` is basically the same (for now).
